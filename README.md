# Mendix Pusher

The Mendix pusher project allows you to push updates to the Mendix pusher widget via the pusher network. This will push triggers a refresh of the entity or entity class which in turn will allow the Mendix client to fetch all required data. It is an easy way to push updates to clients without much custom logic.

TODO: write complete documentation on how to use.
